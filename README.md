This is a simple script to automate the process of generating a reverse-shell command like those described in [pentestmonkey](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) blog:

```
$ ./shellback.py -h
usage: shellback.py [-h] [-l] [-p] [-v] [-f] [-c]

shellback.py: generates a reverse shell

arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -l , --lhost     Specify local host ip
  -p , --lport     Specify a local port [default 8080]
  -v , --version   Specify the language to generate the reverse shell [default bash]
  -f, --tofile     reverse-shell command to be written in a file
  -c, --copy       Copy reverse-shell command to clipboard
```
